      <ul>
        <li>1 cup plus 1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup flour</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
        <li>6 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>6 egg yolks</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>3 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>9 ripe bananas</li>
        <li>2(12 oz) boxes vanilla wafers</li>
        <li>6 egg whites</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp cream of tartar</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h4><strong>Step 1</strong></h4>
        Stir together 1 cup sugar, the flour, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in milk, egg yolks, and whole eggs until well combined and smooth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Pour milk mixture into saucepan with butter; 
        reduce heat to medium-low and whisk constantly until the mixture has thickened, coats the back 
        of a spoon nicely, and begins to bubble, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 2 teaspoons vanilla.
        Cover and let custard cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. (It will continue to thicken as it cools.)
      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>Step 3</h4>
      Peel and slice bananas. Line the bottom and sides of 2 (9x13-inch) 
      broiler-safe casserole dishes with vanilla wafers. Layer banana 
      slices over wafers. Pour cooled custard over bananas and wafers, 
      smoothing top with a knife or spatula.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    For meringue, in a large clean bowl, using an electric mixer or 
    a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites, 
    cream of tartar, and the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 teaspoon
     vanilla at high speed until stiff peaks form, 
    about 5 minutes. Spoon meringue over top of custard, 
    covering it completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>Step 5</h4>
      Set oven rack about 4 inches from broiler; turn broiler to high. 
      Quickly broil meringues until browned, about 1 to 2 minutes. 
      (This happens very quickly, so keep a close eye on it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>Step 6</h4>
      Remove dishes from oven, allow meringue to cool slightly, 
      about 15 minutes, and serve. (Chill, covered, up to 4 days.)
